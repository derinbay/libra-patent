            <h3 align="center"class="text-heading title_color">DOMAIN NAMES</h3>   
                <p>Domain name is the address of a website on the internet and today domain names became an important part of trademarks protection and registration of domain names is very important to protect the trademarks from bad faiths. </p>
                <p>Domain names can be classified as</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Top Level Domain Names</li>
                    <li>Country Level Domain Names</li>
                </ul>               
                <p>There are not any document requirements for some of the domain name extensions but some domains have legal document requirements such as trademark registration, local existence etc. For example, there are not any document requirements for mostly used domain extensions such as  .com, .net, .org, .info. On the other hand for .COM.TR registrations for Turkey, you shall have a trademark registration/application or a trade name.</p>
                <p>In order to protect your trademark rights effectively in Turkey, LIBRA PATENT recommends to obtain the .COM and .COM.TR registrations.</p>
                <h3 class="text-heading title_color">DOMAIN NAME RENEWALS;</h3>
                <p>Domain names can be registered for various periods, ranging from 1 to 10 years, for each extension. In order to avoid any loss of rights domain name renewals must be followed up on a regular basis and completed within the same period.</p>
                <h3 class="text-heading title_color">DOMAIN NAME COMPLAINTS;</h3>
                <p>Since domain names are a very important part of trademark protection and can be taken at very low costs, they are often followed up by malicious people and organizations, creating huge problems and loss of rights for real trademark owners.</p>
                <p>Domain names that are easily registered for small wages are often intended to be sold to genuine trademark owners at exorbitant prices.</p>
                <p>It is possible for such malicious domain names to be canceled or claimed by the real owners via WIPO of the World Intellectual Property Organization by a special complaint procedure.</p>
                <p>However, it is necessary to carefully examine the legal conditions before the complaint process and to examine whether the legal requirements are formed or not.</p>
                <p>Libra Patent has received positive results for its clients with numerous applications for domain name complaints.</p>
                <p>Please contact with Libra Patent to protect and recover your domain names from malicious registrations.</p>
                <h3 class="text-heading title_color">.COM.TR DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATIONS</h3>
                <p>In order to have a COM.TR registration, the applicant shall have a trademark application / registration or a company name identical with the domain name. If the domain name is obtained with a trademark application, domain name remains in the Pending period for oppositions.</p>
                <p>If the trademark application is rejected meanwhile, opposition can be filed against the domain name by proving the rejection of the trademark application.</p>
                <p>In this framework LIBRA PATENT will be very pleased to assist all the colleagues and associates not only for .COM.TR registrations in Turkey but also for the domain name oppositions. Please contact with us for more information and instructions.</p>
