                        <p>The registration of Intellectual and Industrial Property Rights is very important, but registration for protection is not enough. The penetration of the rights that are registered but not protected against counterfeiters by third parties means that they are evicted for their acquired rights. In order to prevent this, it is absolutely necessary to initiate legal proceedings against the persons and institutions that have violated the acquired rights.</p>
						<p>According to the nature of unfair competition or imitation;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Requesting suspension of violation by sending a warning letter</li>
                            <li>Filing law or criminal suits with the courts</li>
                            <li>Collection of counterfeit goods by court or police channel</li>
                            <li>Prevention of entry and exit of counterfeit goods by making necessary applications in customs</li>
							<li>The field investigation for the purpose of determining the counterfeits and the violation are among the transactions that can be done legally.</li>   
						</ul>
						<p>However, it should be remembered that each legal situation is different from each other and should be evaluated under its own conditions.</p>
                        <p>In this respect, Libra Patent and its authorized law firm are at your side in all legal proceedings. For further information and consultation please contact us.</p>
