                <p>The invention is an idea product which is the technical feature of solving a specific problem in the field of technology. Each different solution of the same technical problem is a different invention. The invention has to be of a technical nature.</p>
                <p>The patent is the fundamental right of the owner to the owner, for a limited period of time and for the duration of the invention, to prevent the production, use or sale of the invention by third parties without permission. The document given for this right is called Patent Certificate.</p>

                <p>In the Patent System; the patent certificate is based on a examination report showing whether the application has a patentability criterion (innovation, inventive step, industrial applicability). The Patent Certificate provides 20 years of protection provided that the annual fee is paid each year, this protection period cannot be extended.</p>
                <p>In the Utility Model System; unlike the patent, there is no examination system. Therefore, registration can be obtained in less time and less cost than the patent. In this system certificate is granted based on search report. The utility model certificate provides 10 years of protection provided that annual fees are paid and this protection period cannot be extended.</p>
