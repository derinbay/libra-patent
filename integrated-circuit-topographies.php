                <p><strong><i>Integrated Circuit;</strong></i> Refers to a product of at least one active component designed to fulfill an electronic function or other function such as an intermediate or final form of a portion or all of the interconnections assembled in and / or on a piece of material.</p>
                <p><strong><i>The Integrated Circuit Topography</strong></i> is a sequence of images prepared for production and fixed in any format, showing the three-dimensional arrangement of the layers forming the Integrated Circuit, and each image is expressed as the appearance of the entire or a portion of the surface at any stage of the production of the Integrated Circuit. Protected by issuing a registration certificate of the Integrated Circuit Topographies of the original nature.</p>
                <p>Libra Patent is ready to be your solution partner with your expert staff in the registration and protection of integrated circuit topographies. For more detailed information and instructions please contact us.</p>
                <h3 class="text-heading title_color">LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
                <p>An Integrated Circuit Topography owner is entitled to prevent the following acts, which are made without permission:</p>
                <p><strong>a)</strong> Reproduction of all or part of the protected Integrated Circuit Topography within an Integrated Circuit or any other reproduction, except for the reproduction of parts which do not have the originality requirements.</p>
                <p><strong>b)</strong> The import, sale or distribution of a protected Integrated Circuit Topography containing an Integrated Circuit Topography containing the protected Integrated Circuit Topography or a product containing an illegally reproduced Integrated Circuit Topography.</p>
                <h3 class="text-heading title_color">PROTECTION PERIOD</h3>
                <P>The beginning of the protection provided to the Integrated Circuit Topography; Provided that the application of the Integrated Circuit Topography has been made within two years from the date on which it was firstly marketed by the rights holder or by a third party at home or abroad for the first time from a commercial point of view; the date on which the application was made, in the case of the date on which the said market was issued, or in the case where it was not commercially available.</p>
                <p>Ten years from the start date, which ends at the end of the tenth calendar year. If the Integrated Circuit Topographical is not used commercially, except for cases requiring confidentiality, and the Institute has not been applied for registration within fifteen years from the date of design, the right to protection of the Integrated Circuit Topography can not be claimed.</p>
                <h3 class="text-heading title_color">NECESSARY DOCUMENTS</h3>
                <p><h5><strong><u>Necessary documents for integrated circuit topographies;</u></strong></h5></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Copy or net drawings of the Integrated Circuit Topography, including information describing the electronic functions performed by the Integrated Circuit,</li>
					<li>Summary information on Integrated Circuit Topographies,</li>
					<li>Power of attorney,</li>
					<li>Signature circulars if the application is made on behalf of a legal entity</li>
